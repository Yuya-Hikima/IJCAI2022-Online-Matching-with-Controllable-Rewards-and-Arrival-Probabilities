# IJCAI2022-Online-Matching-with-Controllable-Rewards-and-Arrival-Probabilities

## Remark

This repository is in preparation.

## Overview
This repository contains the codes for the experiments performed in the following papers:
  
Yuya Hikima, Yasunori Akagi, Naoki Marumo, and Hideaki Kim. "Online Matching with Controllable Rewards and ArrivalProbabilities." In IJCAI, 2022 (in press).
  
Contents of this repository:
- **Crowd-sourcing_experiment folder:** It contains the code used in the crowd-sourcing platform experiment and the code needed to set up the experiment, including data downloads.
- **Ride-sharing_experiment folder:** It contains the code used in the ride-sharing platform experiment and the code needed to set up the experiment, including data downloads.

The data for crowd-sourcing experiments are downloaded from
  
http://dbgroup.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/ligl/crowddata/ (Relevance Finding dataset)
  
This data are shared by
  
Chris Buckley, Matthew Lease, and Mark D. Smucker. "Overview of the TREC 2010 Relevance Feedback Track (Notebook)." In TREC, 2010.

The data for ride-sharing experiments are downloaded from TLC Trip Record Data:
  
https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page (Yellow Taxi Trip Records on January-March, 2019).


## Description

    - **data_download.py** It is executed by setup.sh to download the real data.
    - **generate_reward_matrix.py** It is executed by setup.sh to make simulation data from the real data.
    - **experiment_crowdsourcing_gurobi.py** It is executed by Experiment.sh or Experiment_test.sh to perform experiments using simulated data
    - **experiment_crowdsourcing_cbc.py** Experimental code to replace the above if you do not have a grobi license
  - **data** Folder where the downloaded data is stored
  - **work** Folder where the simulation data is stored
    - **Reward_matrix** Data containing w_et in the paper, generated by experiment_crowdsourcing_gurobi.py.

  - **data** Folder containing the downloaded data and the ID information for dividing Manhattan into 20 areas
    - **locationID_to_DO_aggregated_ID.csv** Data showing the correspondence to 20 area IDs for the area ID of the original data
    - **locationID_to_PU_aggregated_ID.csv** Data showing the correspondence to 20 area IDs for the area ID of the original data
    - **Aggregated_location** Location data for 20 area IDs

## Requirement
It is desirable to have a license of Gurobi solver.
If you do not have a license for Gurobi solver, you can use a free CBC solver instead of gurobi.
(However, the performance of baselines of CU-A, BO-A, and RS-A is slightly lower by the replacement.)

## Usage
For each experiment, we explain how to perform the experiment.

**Crowd-sourcing_experiment** 
1. Go to the Crowd-sourcing_experiment folder and run "bash setup.sh."
2. If you do not have a license for Gurobi solver, replace "_gurobi" with "_cbc" inside Experiment_paper.sh and Experiment_test.sh.
3. Run "Experiment_test.sh" and see the results in the "results" folder to see if the code works.
4. Run "Experiment_paper.sh" and see the results in the "results." Note that 

## Licence
You must follow the terms of the "SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR EVALUATION".
Be sure to read it.
